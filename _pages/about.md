Hello!  I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the  [Professorship of Autonomous Vehicle Systems](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/en/avs/home/) at the School of Engineering and Design, [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of Professor [Dr.-Ing. Johannes Betz](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/betz-johannes). My research focuses on scenario generation based on LLMs. I have recently graduated with the double Master degree in Mechatronics and Robotics with high distinction, as well as Development, Production, and Management in Mechanical Engineering with distinction from the same university [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) in 2023.

During my master's studies, I conducted my research at the [Chair of Information-oriented Control](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home/) under the supervision of [Dr. Junjie Jiao](https://junjiejiao.github.io/) and Professor [Dr.-Ing. Sandra Hirche](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hirche-sandra), where I completed my master's thesis. Prior to that, I worked as a student research assistant and wrote my term's thesis at the [Chair of Automotive Technology](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/en/ftm/home/) under the supervision of Professor [Dr.-Ing. Markus Lienkamp](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/lienkamp-markus).

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacture, and Automation with Excellent Graduate honors at School of Mechanical Engineering, [Hefei University of Technology](https://jxxysme.hfut.edu.cn/), China in 2017.
